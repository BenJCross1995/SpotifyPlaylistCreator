# SpotifyPlaylistCreator
Repository containing the code to create a Spotify playlist based on artists past setlists.

To use this file you must create a Setlist FM account and request an API Key - https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html - and you must also have a spotify account and retieve you username as well as create a Spotify developers account and retieve the Client ID and Client Secret - https://developer.spotify.com/

You must add these details to the relevant sections of the code, BASE SETLIST FM INFORMATION and BASE SPOTIFY INFORMATION respectively.

I will add more detailed instructions and continue to edit the code in due time.
